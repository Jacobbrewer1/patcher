# Patcher

Patcher is a GO library that provides a simple way to generate and SQL patches from structs. The library was built out
of the need to generate patches for a database; when a new field is added to a struct, this would result in a bunch of
new `if` checks to be created in the codebase. This library aims to solve that problem by generating the SQL patches for
you.

## Usage

#### Basic

To use the library, you need to create a struct that represents the table you want to generate patches for. The struct
should have the following tags:

- `db:"column_name"`: This tag is used to specify the column name in the database.

Example:

```go
package main

import (
	"encoding/json"
	"fmt"

	"github.com/Jacobbrewer1/patcher"
)

type Person struct {
	ID   *int    `db:"id"`
	Name *string `db:"name"`
	Age  *int    `db:"age"`
}

type PersonWhere struct {
	ID *int `db:"id"`
}

func NewPersonWhere(id int) *PersonWhere {
	return &PersonWhere{
		ID: &id,
	}
}

func (p *PersonWhere) Where() (string, []any) {
	return "id = ?", []any{*p.ID}
}

func main() {
	const jsonStr = `{"name": "John", "age": 25}`

	person := new(Person)
	if err := json.Unmarshal([]byte(jsonStr), person); err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	condition := NewPersonWhere(1)

	sqlStr, args, err := patcher.GenerateSQL(
		person,
		patcher.WithTable("people"),
		patcher.WithWhere(condition),
	)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	fmt.Println(sqlStr)
	fmt.Println(args)
}
```

This will output:

```sql
UPDATE people
SET name = ?,
    age  = ?
WHERE (1 = 1)
  AND (
    id = ?
    )
```

with the args:

```
["John", 25, 1]
```

#### Struct diffs

If you would like to generate an update script from two structs, you can use the `NewDiffSQLPatch` function. This
function will generate an update script from the two structs.

Example:

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/Jacobbrewer1/patcher"
)

type Something struct {
	Number       int
	Text         string
	PrePopulated string
	NewText      string
}

type SomeWhere struct {
	id int
}

func NewSomeWhere(id int) *SomeWhere {
	return &SomeWhere{id: id}
}

func (s *SomeWhere) Where() (string, []any) {
	return "id = ?", []any{s.id}
}

func main() {
	s := Something{
		Number:       5,
		Text:         "Old Text",
		PrePopulated: "PrePopulated",
		NewText:      "New Text",
	}

	n := Something{
		Number:       5,
		Text:         "Old Text",
		PrePopulated: "PrePopulatedDifferent",
		NewText:      "New Text",
	}

	wherer := NewSomeWhere(5)

	// The patcher.LoadDiff function will apply the changes from n to s.
	patch, err := patcher.NewDiffSQLPatch(
		&s,
		&n,
		patcher.WithTable("table_name"),
		patcher.WithWhere(wherer),
	)
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	sqlStr, sqlArgs, err := patch.GenerateSQL()
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	fmt.Println(sqlStr)
	fmt.Println(sqlArgs)
}

```

This will output:

```sql
UPDATE table_name
SET pre_populated = ?
WHERE (1 = 1)
  AND (
    id = ?
    )
```

with the args:

```
["PrePopulatedDifferent", 5]
```

You can also take a look at the Loader [examples](./examples) for more examples on how to use the library for this
approach.

#### Using `OR` in the where clause

If you would like to use `OR` in the where clause, you can apply the `patcher.WhereTyper` interface to your where
struct. Please take a look at the [example here](./examples/where_type).

### Joins

To generate a join, you need to create a struct that represents the join. This struct should implement
the [Joiner](./joiner.go) interface.

Once you have the join struct, you can pass it to the `GenerateSQL` function using the `WithJoin` option. You can add as
many of these as you would like.
